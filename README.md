# MOODVIES 


## Moodvies is a web application that makes movie suggestions based on your mood.

The application allows users to take a photo or upload a photo for analysis using cloudinary. 
The user photo is then analyzed using the Face++ API which issues a percentage of emotion values. 
Those values are used to calculate an appropriate movie selection using the movie genre tags from the TMDB API.

Our development team created an easy and eye-catching one page user interface for the photo upload 
and a movie suggestion page with up to 10 results.
